# Aftermath
 For the first time in a long time a wild card team got all the way to the world series and won it all. I wasn't able to find an image that showed Washington winning the world series, but this is close enough. This is the first time the Washington Nationals have won a world series in franchise history. Houston also had the best record in the league where Washington wasn't even close, no one predicted Washington would walk away as the victor. The thing I find the most hilarious is that the year after Bryce Harper leaves the Nationals they win the world series. The most overrated player ever.

 # Plans for Future Development
 In the future I would like to make my ordered lists a little better, but at the time I could not think of a better way to do it. I would also like to add more images to show how the teams look and show the field during games. Other than that I think I did a pretty good job on this and I am quite proud of it since I have so many other things to do. Thank you and goodbye.
